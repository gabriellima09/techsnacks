## System Requirements

<p>TechSnacks works in a delivery business model and customers may call to order their food. The attendants should make an order based on customer needs and everything starts by the attendant asking customer's phone number and their full name to start the order. A soft-register should be make to facilitate further interactions if the customers is new ordering something. Later, users can use same register based on their phone number to order food by themselves. The register could be done by the attendants by calling TechSnacks or the customers itself can register his informations during their first order in the system.</p>
<p>After that, the products screen should appear with all products listed and sorted by their categories informing: Name, Description (usually to inform ingredients) and Price. All products can be choosed more than once (depending on store quantity on-hand) to customer's cart.
